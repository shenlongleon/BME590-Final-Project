### BME590-Final-Project
#### Optimizing Sparse View Raw CT Data for Intracranial Hemorrhage Classification
In this project, we build a machine learning model to classify intracranial hemorrhage based on sparse view raw CT data. We implement two separate trainable physical layers to simulate changing mean effective energy of X-ray at each CT scan and image filtering applied before back projection. We evaluate the performance of four models that consist different physical layers. To explore the effect of sparsity in sinogram on classification accuracy, we trained our final model with eight datasets containing different number of projections. We found that the Fourier mask layer brings more improvements to our model and a projection number greater than five will guarantee us a validation accuracy above 80%.
